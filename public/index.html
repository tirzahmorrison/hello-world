      <p class="par">The early days of the internet web design was extremely basic, consisting mainly of tags, headers, links and paragraphs.
        Visual design was not yet possible because design layout didn’t exist as the first websites were text-based. In the
        mid-nineties graphical design elements started to become popular but it was still new and clumsy. By the 2000’s CSS
        saw increasing support which allowed for the separation of design and content. The added creative freedom made it
        more enjoyable for designers and programmers, as websites became more flexible, easier to maintain and faster.</p>

      <p class="par">Web design has now strongly established itself as an important part of nearly every marketing strategy. I believe as
        the digital revolution continues to evolve, we will continue to re-evaluate the way websites are structured and responsive
        design will become more popular and natural. I also think that this will push UI and especially UX designers into
        the lime light. UX/UI design will be needed to further push the boundaries of human computer interaction as it interfaces
        with our online and mobile lives. </p>
